# Image Depixelation Project

This is a machine learning project for depixelating images. Here I have used neural networks such as CNN to dipixelate some parts of an image which was previously pixelated.This is the project for the "Programming in Python II" course at the Johannes Kepler University Linz.

## Structure
```
ImageDipixelationProject2023
|- architectures.py
|    Classes and functions needed for network architectures
|- datasets.py
|    Dataset classes and dataset helper functions. 
|- main.py
|    Main file. In this case also includes training and evaluation functions.
|- README.md
|    A readme file containing info on project.
|- utils.py
|    Utility functions and classes. Here you will find the plotting function.
|- working_config.json
|    An example configuration file. So one can run via command line arguments to main.py.
